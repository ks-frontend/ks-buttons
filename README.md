# The ks-buttons library

This library is dependent of the ks-core library.

This library contains many mixins and jquery functions which are easily to extend from and configure.

For maximum flexibility to retrieve updates, you should not modify directly the library but instead extend the library from a different folder.

# Installation with bower

```console
$ bower install ks-buttons
```
